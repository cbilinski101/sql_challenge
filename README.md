# sql_challenge
This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling.png
Inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD.
  
## Data Engineering.sql
Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files and completed the following:
* Specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints
* For the primary keys, verified that the column is unique and created composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row
* Created the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys
* Changed the date format (using Excel) for the "employees.csv" columns "birth_date & hire_date" to YYYY-MM-DD format to sync with PostgresSQL
* Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

## Data Analysis.sql
Completed the following queries:
* List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee
* List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986
* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name
* List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name
* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B
* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name
* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
* List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
